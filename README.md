# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains code to train and compare machine learning models for predicting survival on the Titanic. The following models are used for comparison:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Neural Network (using TensorFlow)

## Requirements

Before running the code, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by creating a virtual environment and using `pip` to install the dependencies.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.10
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow (for the neural network model)
- matplotlib (for plotting)
- seaborn (for visualization)

You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
